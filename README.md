# Spotify-Shuffle

This web application takes all of the songs in your spotify accound playlists and shuffles them into a "Spotify Shuffle" playlist, which you can then stream from the page. It uses user credentials to hit Spotify's API and gather your tunes.

It is created with Node.js, JavaScript, jQuery, Jade, and [this node client/wrapper for the Spotify API](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node)
